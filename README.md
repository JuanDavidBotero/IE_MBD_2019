Linear Regression: A report on a regression project carried out in Dataiku.

Programming: Contains 3 sections:

R: A series of R codes that were used to a) predict solar production (Kaggle Dataset) and b) Create an R-Markdown and Shiny.

SQL: A series of SQL queries that were written to extract data for a Luxury_Cruise company and answer some pre-defined questions.
