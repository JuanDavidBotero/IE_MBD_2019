2. Data Visualiation: Contains a Tableau dashboard created after database creation in MySQL and ETL done using Pentaho.

3. Database Creation: Two models (star-schema). The first one (Luxury_Cruise) was a model designed for a luxury cruise company and the second (Social Media) a model designed to analyse a social media marketing program (used in ETL and Data Visualization)

4. ETL: Contains Pentaho files and the ETL flow for the social media marketing program.

-- Linear Regression: A report on a regression project carried out in Dataiku.

8. Programming: Contains 2 sections:
